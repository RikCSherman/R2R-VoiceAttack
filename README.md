Sextant is an exploration assistant for [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/), and runs as a [VoiceAttack](https://voiceattack.com/) plugin. 

Using navigation data provided from the [Road to Riches](http://edtools.ddns.net/expl.php) tool, Sextant will classify which planets you need to scan, which system you need to visit next, which planet needs to be scanned next and updates on what needs to be scanned when jumping into a system or on request.
